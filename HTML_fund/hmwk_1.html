				<li>Stir the sweetener and yeast into the hot water. Allow to proof for around 10 minutes</li>
				<li>Combine, in the standing mixer, both flours, the salt and flax seed.</li>
				<li>Using the dough hook of your mixer, combine the flour mix and proofed yeast until your dough is thoroughly mixed. This dough should release from the mixing bowl's sides while having no dry spots. If needed, add more flour, &#189; tablespoon at a time, to stiffen the dough. Or, add water, &#189; tablespoon at a time, to further incorporate dry flour. This may be beyond the dough hook's purview so grab that spoon.</li>
				<li>Using about half of the olive oil, coat the sides of a metal bowl. Spread a very thin layer.</li>
				<li>Move your dough ball into the first of the metal bowls. Cover the dough and allow to rise for about four hours at room temperature.</li>
				<li>At this point, use the remaining olive oil to apply a thin coating in your bread pan. You can also set the oven to 425&#8457;.</li>
				<li>Coat a countertop with some of the remaining white flour and turn the dough ball onto this surface.</li>
				<li>Knead the sunflower seeds and oats into the dough. Do not knead too much!</li>
				<li>Knead the dough into the shape of the bread pan and place it in the bottom of the pan. Cover this with a towel for 15 to 25 minutes while the oven heats up.</li>
				<li>When the oven reaches temperature, put about one cup of tap water into the metal skillet and place this on the bottom rack of the oven. Place the bread pan with dough on a rack above the skillet and bake for 30 - 32 minutes.</li>
				<li>Take that pan out and allow the bread to cool on the cooling rack.</li>
				<li>Eat the entire thing as soon as it's cool enough.</li>
				<li><h6>Profit.</h6></li>
